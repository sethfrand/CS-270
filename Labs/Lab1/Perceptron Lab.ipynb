The decision line is determine by the model after it processes the intake data and the weights, with each misclassification, the weights are adjusted. THis process is iterated a predetermined amount of epochs or until it converges, whichever comes first. The slope of the line of seperability is determined by the weights, a change in the weights is a change in the slope. The y-intercept of the line of seperability is the bias which is determined as the model runs."

But how do you know how many epochs to run until convergence?  One way is to just to first run it until convergence with random_state = c to see how many epochs it took (n_iter_).  Then run it again one epoch at a time n_iter_ times using the same random_state constant c (so that you get the exact same conditions).\n",
